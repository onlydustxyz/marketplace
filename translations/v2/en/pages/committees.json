A 0 is a non-vote. There is a conflict if you have invested or have a close relationship with a project (employee, employer, investor in your project, biggest customer, best friend, etc.)\n\nThe 4 criteria are here to help, but ultimately, we count the aggregate vote. So, if you have a very strong opinion, you can give only 5 or only 1, even if it doesn't match the reality of each criterion.\n\nIf you have a question, reach __link__ on TG.\nWe are here to help.",
