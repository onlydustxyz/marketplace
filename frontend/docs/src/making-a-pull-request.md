# Making a pull request

## Microcommits & Gitmoji

Commits should strive to be as unitary as possible. Using Gitmoji for commit messages helps each commit to have a distinct purpose.

This can prove very helpful for code reviews as well as for development.

## Linting

Linting should be configured to be applied on save in your editor.

You can also manually lint the frontend code with:

```typescript
yarn lint --fix
```
