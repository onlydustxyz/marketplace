# Description of the app

The marketplace project is organized in different components and routes. The main entry point for the application is the `App` component, which is responsible for rendering the different pages and routes of the application. It imports various components and libraries from the React ecosystem, as well as custom components and types from the project.

The `App` component defines an enumeration called `RoutePaths` that represents the different routes of the application. It also defines enumerations called `ProjectRoutePaths` and `ProjectPaymentsRoutePaths` that represent sub-routes within the project details and project payments pages, respectively.

The `App` component uses the `useReloadOnNewRelease` hook to reload the application if a new release is available. It also defines arrays called `projectRoutes` and `routes` using the `useRoutes` hook. These arrays represent the routes of the application and include nested routes and protected routes based on user roles.

The `Layout` component is responsible for rendering the layout of the marketplace application. It uses various components and hooks to create the desired layout, such as `classNames`, `Outlet`, `useLocation`, `ResponsivityFallback`, `Toaster`, `Header`, and `Tooltip`. The `Layout` component conditionally renders the `ResponsivityFallback` component and controls the visibility of the main content based on the current location.

## Example of a page

The `Projects` component is responsible for rendering a page that displays a list of projects. It imports dependencies and components such as `Background`, `FilterPanel`, `useAuth`, and `useT`. It defines an enum called `Sorting` for different sorting options and uses the `useLocalStorage` hook to store and retrieve the selected sorting option. The component renders the `Background` component, `ProjectFilterProvider`, and a list of projects using the `AllProjects` component.

## Example of a component

The `ProjectDetails` component is responsible for rendering the details of a specific project. It imports dependencies and components such as `Navigate`, `useParams`, `LanguageMap`, `ProjectLeadFragment`, `SponsorFragment`, and `View`. It defines an interface called `ProjectDetails` for the structure of a project object. The component uses the `useParams` hook to extract the `projectId` from the URL parameters and the `useProjectVisibility` hook to determine if the project is visible to the current user. It conditionally renders the `View` component or navigates to the `Projects` route.
